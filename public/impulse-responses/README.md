# Impulse Responses

Place impulse response WAV files in this directory for convolution reverb.

## Expected File
- `cathedral.wav` - Church/cathedral impulse response

## Recommended Sources (Creative Commons)
- OpenAir Library: http://www.openairlib.net/
- St. George's Episcopal Church (York, UK)
- York Minster

## Fallback Behavior
If no IR file is present, the application uses algorithmic reverb (Tone.Reverb).
