KEY ADAPTATIONS FROM ORIGINAL PLAN
================================================================================

ORIGINAL PROMPT-01 ASSUMPTIONS:
- User authentication required (email/password + OAuth)
- Cloud database for "My Blocks" library
- Multi-device synchronization
- Offline queue management

- Performance benchmarks (separate deliverable)

NEUME ACTUAL STATE:
- NO user accounts (localStorage only)
- NO cloud database (moved to Phase 1.5)
- NO multi-device sync
- NO offline queues
- Manual testing focus (no Playwright)
- Practical 2-3 hour test timeline

RESULT:
✓ 7 scenarios adapted intelligently
✗ 2 scenarios removed (UAT-04 Offline, UAT-05 Multi-Device)
✓ 2 scenarios repurposed (UAT-06 Extended Chords, UAT-07 Save/Load)
✓ 5 scenarios preserved with modifications
