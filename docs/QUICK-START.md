## Three AI Features You'll Love

### 1. Analyze
Want to learn what chords are in a song? Paste a YouTube URL into the **Analyze** button and it extracts the chords for you.

### 2. Why This?
Click on any chord and see why it's there! Get explanations about its function, voice leading, and musical context.

### 3. Refine
Select some chords you want to improve, click **Refine**, and get AI suggestions for alternatives.

## Changing the Vibe

- **Change Key**: Use the Key dropdown (C, D, E, etc.) - all chords reinterpret to the new key
- **Change Mode**: Switch between Major and Minor - affects chord qualities
- **Change Tempo**: Drag the tempo dial (bottom-right) or use arrow keys
- **Zoom In/Out**: Use the 0.5x / 1x / 2x buttons to see more or less of the timeline

## Save Your Work

All changes auto-save to your browser. To explicitly save with a name:

1. Click **My Progressions** button
2. Click **Save Current**
3. Give it a title (e.g., "Sad Minor Waltz")
4. Click Save

To load it back later: **My Progressions** → Find it → Click Load

## Storage Important Notes

- Your progressions live in **browser localStorage** (your device only)
- Nothing is uploaded to any server
- **Clearing your browser cache = losing all progressions** (so save important ones!)
- Each browser/device has separate storage
- Typical limit is 5-50 MB, so you can store many progressions

## If Something Goes Wrong

**No sound?** → Click Play once to initialize audio, then try again

**Progression vanished?** → Try refreshing the page first. If it's still gone, browser cache was cleared.

**Analyze not working?** → Use a valid YouTube URL or audio file under 50 MB

**Chords changed when I switched keys?** → This is intentional! Neume thinks in scale degrees, so V in C Major becomes V in G Major (a different note).

## Next Steps

1. **Experiment**: Try adding/removing chords and listening
2. **Analyze a song**: Click Analyze and paste a YouTube URL
3. **Learn theory**: Click on a chord and read the "Why This?" explanation
4. **Save & organize**: Build a library of progressions in My Progressions
5. **Read the full guide**: Open `/docs/USER-GUIDE.md` for detailed explanations

**Happy composing!** 🎵
